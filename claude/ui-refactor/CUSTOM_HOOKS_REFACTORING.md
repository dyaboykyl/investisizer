# Custom Hooks Refactoring

## Objective
Extract repeated logic patterns into custom hooks to improve code reusability and reduce duplication across components.

## Current State Analysis
- **Problem**: Components contain repeated logic patterns for common functionality
- **Opportunity**: Extract useClickOutside, useKeyPress, useIntersectionObserver, useFormInput, useLocalStorage

## Proposed Solution
According to UI_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md:

```typescript
// src/features/shared/hooks/
├── useClickOutside.ts         // Used in TabBar.tsx and could be reused in modals
├── useKeyPress.ts             // For escape key handling
├── useIntersectionObserver.ts // Used in DisplayOptions.tsx
├── useFormInput.ts            // Handle input state and validation
├── useLocalStorage.ts         // Sync state with localStorage
└── index.ts                   // Barrel exports
```

## Implementation Plan
1. **Analyze current components for repeated logic patterns**
2. **Extract useClickOutside hook**
3. **Extract useKeyPress hook**
4. **Extract useIntersectionObserver hook**
5. **Extract useFormInput hook**
6. **Extract useLocalStorage hook**
7. **Refactor components to use new hooks**
8. **Create hooks directory structure**
9. **Test and verify functionality**

## Progress Log

### Phase 1: Analysis ✅
- ✅ Searched for repeated logic patterns across components
- ✅ Identified click outside handling patterns in MobileAssetMenu, AddAssetDropdown, Modal
- ✅ Found keyboard event handling patterns (escape key) in same components
- ✅ Located intersection observer usage (can be extracted later)
- ✅ Analyzed form input patterns (already handled in form components)
- ✅ Reviewed localStorage usage (can be extracted later)

### Phase 2: Hook Extraction ✅
- ✅ Extract useClickOutside hook
- ✅ Extract useKeyPress hook
- ✅ Extract useEscapeKey hook (specialized version)
- ✅ Extract useClickOutsideMultiple hook (for multiple refs)
- ✅ Extract useKeyPressMultiple hook (for multiple key handlers)
- ✅ Refactor components to use new hooks

### Phase 2.1: Component Refactoring ✅
- ✅ Refactor MobileAssetMenu to use useClickOutside and useEscapeKey
- ✅ Refactor AddAssetDropdown to use useClickOutsideMultiple and useEscapeKey
- ✅ Refactor Modal to use useKeyPress for escape key handling

### Phase 3: Directory Organization ✅
- ✅ Create hooks directory structure: `src/features/shared/hooks/`
- ✅ Update imports and exports in refactored components
- ✅ Create barrel exports in index.ts

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation ✅
- ✅ Verify all hook functionality works (build succeeded)
- ✅ Run tests (all 417 tests passing)
- ✅ Check bundle size impact (940.65 kB, minimal impact)
- ✅ Validate hook reusability (successfully used across 3 components)

## Results Summary
- **Hooks Created**: 5 focused hooks (useClickOutside, useClickOutsideMultiple, useKeyPress, useKeyPressMultiple, useEscapeKey)
- **Components Refactored**: 3 components (MobileAssetMenu, AddAssetDropdown, Modal)
- **Code Reduction**: Eliminated ~40 lines of duplicate event handling code
- **Bundle Size**: 940.65 kB (minimal impact)
- **Tests**: All 417 tests passing
- **Functionality**: 100% preserved with improved reusability

## Expected Benefits
- Reduced code duplication across components
- Better logic reuse and consistency
- Easier testing of isolated logic
- Improved maintainability
- Single source of truth for common patterns

## Notes
- Hooks should be generic and reusable
- Must maintain existing functionality
- Should follow React hooks best practices
- Need to handle cleanup properly
