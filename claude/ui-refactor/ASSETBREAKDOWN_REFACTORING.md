# AssetBreakdownSelector Component Refactoring

## Objective
Break down the AssetBreakdownSelector.tsx component (194 lines) into smaller, focused components to improve maintainability and reduce complexity.

## Current State Analysis
- **File:** `src/features/portfolio/components/AssetBreakdownSelector.tsx`
- **Lines:** 194 lines
- **Problem:** Complex component with nested logic for different asset types

## Proposed Breakdown
According to UI_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md:

```typescript
// src/features/portfolio/components/breakdown/
├── AssetBreakdownSelector.tsx     // Main selector container
├── AssetBreakdownItem.tsx         // Individual asset breakdown item
├── InvestmentBreakdown.tsx        // Investment-specific breakdown
├── PropertyBreakdown.tsx          // Property-specific breakdown
└── AssetLinkingIndicator.tsx      // Shows property-investment links
```

## Implementation Plan
1. **Analyze current AssetBreakdownSelector.tsx structure**
2. **Extract AssetBreakdownItem component**
3. **Extract InvestmentBreakdown component**
4. **Extract PropertyBreakdown component**
5. **Extract AssetLinkingIndicator component**
6. **Refactor main AssetBreakdownSelector to use extracted components**
7. **Create breakdown directory structure**
8. **Test and verify functionality**

## Progress Log

### Phase 1: Analysis ✅
- ✅ Examined current AssetBreakdownSelector.tsx structure (194 lines)
- ✅ Identified component boundaries and responsibilities:
  - AssetBreakdownItem (header, checkbox, breakdown display)
  - AssetLinkingIndicator (property-investment links)
  - InvestmentBreakdown (investment-specific breakdown)
  - PropertyBreakdown (property-specific breakdown)
- ✅ Understanding asset type handling logic
- ✅ Determined data flow and props

### Phase 2: Component Extraction ✅
- ✅ Extract AssetBreakdownItem (main container with header and checkbox)
- ✅ Extract InvestmentBreakdown (investment-specific display with linked properties)
- ✅ Extract PropertyBreakdown (property-specific display with mortgage details)
- ✅ Extract AssetLinkingIndicator (purple badges for property-investment links)
- ✅ Refactor main AssetBreakdownSelector (reduced from 194 lines to 62 lines - 68% reduction)

### Phase 3: Directory Organization ✅
- ✅ Create breakdown directory structure: `src/features/portfolio/components/breakdown/`
- ✅ Update imports and exports in main AssetBreakdownSelector
- ✅ Create barrel exports in index.ts

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation ✅
- ✅ Verify all functionality works (build succeeded)
- ✅ Run tests (all 417 tests passing)
- ✅ Check bundle size impact (939.56 kB, minimal increase)
- ✅ Validate asset breakdown displays correctly

## Results Summary
- **Original AssetBreakdownSelector.tsx**: 194 lines
- **Refactored AssetBreakdownSelector.tsx**: 62 lines (68% reduction)
- **Components Created**: 4 focused components
- **Bundle Size**: 939.56 kB (minimal increase due to better organization)
- **Tests**: All 417 tests passing
- **Functionality**: 100% preserved

## Key Achievements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles a specific aspect of asset breakdown
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused for different asset types
3. **Maintainability**: Much easier to modify asset-specific display logic
4. **Code Organization**: Logical grouping in `/breakdown/` directory
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types for asset breakdown data structure

## Expected Benefits
- Reduced component complexity
- Better separation of concerns between asset types
- Easier testing of individual breakdown components
- Improved maintainability for asset-specific logic
- Clearer data flow and props

## Notes
- Component handles both investment and property assets
- Contains complex conditional rendering based on asset types
- Need to preserve all asset linking functionality
- Must maintain accurate financial calculations display
