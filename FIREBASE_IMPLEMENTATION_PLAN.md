# Firebase Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementing Firebase authentication and cloud sync functionality for the Investisizer React app. This implementation follows existing code practices with React components having no logic and using MobX stores with observable properties and computed values.

## Current Status: COMPLETED âœ…

### High Priority Tasks
- [âœ…] **firebase-setup**: Set up Firebase configuration and services with environment separation
- [âœ…] **auth-store**: Create AuthStore with Google and email authentication
- [âœ…] **firestore-service**: Implement FirestoreService for portfolio data operations
- [âœ…] **portfolio-cloud-sync**: Add cloud sync methods to PortfolioStore (save/load/migrate)
- [âœ…] **root-store-integration**: Update RootStore to include AuthStore and cloud sync reactions

### Medium Priority Tasks
- [âœ…] **auth-ui-components**: Create AuthModal and SyncStatus UI components
- [âœ…] **header-integration**: Update Layout/Header to include auth and sync status
- [âœ…] **investment-property-serialization**: Add toJSON/fromJSON methods to Investment and Property classes

### Low Priority Tasks
- [âœ…] **environment-variables**: Set up .env files for dev and prod Firebase configs
- [âœ…] **firebase-dependencies**: Install Firebase npm package

## Implementation Strategy

### Key Conflict-Avoidance Strategies
1. **New file structure** - All Firebase code goes in new files (`src/services/`, `src/features/core/stores/AuthStore.ts`)
2. **Additive changes** - PortfolioStore gets new methods without modifying existing ones
3. **Separate UI components** - AuthModal and SyncStatus are standalone components
4. **Environment isolation** - Dev/prod Firebase projects prevent conflicts during development

### Code Practice Compliance
- React components will have no logic and use MobX stores
- MobX stores will contain observable properties
- Everything that can be computed will be computed
- Following existing patterns for store integration and component structure

## File Structure Plan

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ firebase.config.ts    # Environment-based Firebase config
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ firebase.ts           # Firebase app initialization
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ firestore.ts          # Firestore service methods
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ stores/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AuthStore.ts  # Authentication store
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ RootStore.ts  # Updated to include AuthStore
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ AuthModal.tsx # Authentication modal component
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ SyncStatus.tsx # Sync status indicator
```

## Progress Log
- âœ… Firebase dependencies installed successfully
- âœ… Firebase configuration and services created with environment separation
- âœ… AuthStore implemented with MobX observables and computed properties
- âœ… FirestoreService created for portfolio operations
- âœ… PortfolioStore enhanced with cloud sync methods (save/load/migrate)
- âœ… AuthModal and SyncStatus UI components created (no logic, pure presentation)
- âœ… Layout component updated with auth and sync status integration
- âœ… RootStore updated with AuthStore and cloud sync reactions
- âœ… Environment variable templates created for dev and prod configs

## Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All planned Firebase sync functionality has been successfully implemented following the existing code practices:

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Authentication**: Google OAuth and email/password auth via AuthStore
2. **Cloud Sync**: Auto-save portfolio data to Firestore with 2-second debounce
3. **Data Migration**: Automatic migration of localStorage data to cloud on first sign-in
4. **UI Integration**: Clean auth modal and sync status indicators in header
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
6. **Environment Support**: Separate dev/prod Firebase configurations

## Implementation Notes
- Maintaining existing localStorage functionality as fallback
- Cloud sync will be additive enhancement layer
- Auto-save with 2-second debounce when signed in
- Simple last-write-wins conflict resolution
- Environment separation for safe development

## Next Steps for Deployment

To make this implementation functional, you'll need to:

1. **Create Firebase Projects**:
   - Create `investisizer-dev` Firebase project for development
   - Use existing `investisizer` project for production

2. **Configure Authentication**:
   - Enable Google OAuth in Firebase Auth console
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
   - Add authorized domains (localhost for dev, your domain for prod)

3. **Set Up Firestore**:
   - Create Firestore database in both projects
   - Deploy the security rules from the design document

4. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Replace placeholder values in `.env.development` and `.env.production`
   - Add actual Firebase config values from project settings

5. **Test Implementation**:
   - Run development server: `npm run dev`
   - Test sign-in, portfolio sync, and cross-device functionality
   - Verify offline persistence and error handling

The implementation is complete and ready for Firebase project setup!
